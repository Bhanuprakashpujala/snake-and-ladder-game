# snake-and-ladder-game
creating a snake and ladder game using python random module and python function.
This code appears to be a simple implementation of a game of Snake and Ladder for two players in Python. Here is a brief overview of how the code works:

1.The code starts by asking the user to enter the names of two players, and initializing the positions of the players to 0.

2.The code then prints a greeting message to the players, and defines two dictionaries ladder_jump and snake_bites that represent the positions of the ladders and snakes in the game, respectively.

3.The code then defines a function move that takes a player's position as input, simulates rolling a dice by generating a random integer between 1 and 6, and updates the player's position based on the value of the dice roll. If the dice roll is a 6, the player gets another turn,If the player lands on a ladder the player gets another turn. If the player lands on a ladder or snake, the player's position is updated accordingly.

4.The code then enters an infinite loop, where it alternately asks each player to press a button to throw the dice. When a player throws the dice, the code calls the move function to update the player's position, and checks if the player has reached position 100. If a player has reached position 100, the game ends and the player is declared the winner.
